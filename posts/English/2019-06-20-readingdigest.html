<h3 id="the-guardian-view-on-the-notre-dame-fire-we-share-frances-terrible-loss">The Guardian View on the Notre Dame fire: we share France's terrible loss</h3>
<p>It feels as though the very heart of France and the soul of Europe have been suddenly and viciously ripped out. The fire that coursed through large sections of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday evening was an act of blind and terrible destruction that causes a great stab of emotional pain to us all.</p>
<p>The fire struck quickly and seemingly uncontrollably. It gathered force with immense power and ferocity, engulfing much of the roof and the cathedral spire as it caught hold. After an hour or so, the Paris fire brigade was able to begin to get part of the fire under some degree of control and to protect the parts of the cathedral that may survive. As night fell, the great west towers still stood against the sky, proud but vulnerable.</p>
<p>Dame is the embodiment of the French capital and of France itself. It has been in its place since the 12th century. It was here that the liberation of Paris in 1944 was marked in service of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>It is world famous not simply as an iconic Parisian building but through the writing of Victor Hugo, who in his novel Hunchback of Notre Dame made the building itself come alive.</p>
<p>The cathedral will rise again in time. This terrible fire is not an event that should be trivialised or banalised. We stand with France in its hour of heartbreak. We will never, ever, turn away.</p>
<h3 id="no-word-of-a-lie-scientists-rate-the-worlds-biggest-peddlers-of-bull">No word of a lie: scientists rate the world's biggest peddlers of bull</h3>
<p>In new research, scientists claim to have identified the most common practitioners of the ignoble art--bullshit. Their study of 40,000 teenagers reveals that boys; those from privileged backgrounds; and North Americans in particular, top the charts as the worst offenders.</p>
<h3 id="why-urban-millennials-love-uniqlo">Why urban millennials love Uniqlo</h3>
<p>A pair of Uniqlo slacks is never going to look like a $200 pair from a high -end competitor. But becasue Uniqlo offers free tailoring, the pants are probably not going to look like you got them for $40, either.</p>
<h3 id="not-so-fantastic-can-japan-end-its-love-affair-with-plastic">Not so fantastic: can Japan end its love affair with plastic?</h3>
<p>From bento boxes to individually wrapped bananas, plastic reigns supreme in Japan. But amid global concern about single-use waste, new legislation could help end the country's love affair with plastic.</p>
<h3 id="the-matrix-at-20-how-the-sci-fi-gamechangeer-remains-influential">The Matrix at 20: how the sci-fi gamechangeer remains influential</h3>
<p>The Matrix wasn't about the internet per se -- it takes place in a dystopian future, approximately 200 years from the present -- but it understood where things were header far better than any film did at the time. Back in 1999, the mind-expanding adventures of Neo, Trinity and Morpheus in a world ruled by machines felt more like a technical revolution that a cultural one, an ultra-stylish Hollywood thriller that wedded the balletic cool of Hong Kong action movie with the stunning elasticity of CGI.</p>
<p>Yet objects tend to shift during flight, and in the year 2019, The Matrix has endured as both touchstone and Rorschach blot, a way for people of vastly different ideologies to make sense of the world around them. The effects are still a marvel, but the film's ideas have taken a root in a destabilized culture where conspiracy theories flourish and individuals are defining for themselves what is and isn't real.</p>
<p>For a film of such immense scale and complexity, The Matrix now seems remarkably hopeful about the future, which separates it from the technophobic films of the day. Neo may be shaken by learning the dystopia and falsehood of the world as he once understood it, but other paths open up where he can become fully himself, unbound by the dictation of others. The internet has helped make the positive transformation possible, and the Wachowskis, the film's directors, saw it long before other film-makers did.</p>
<h3 id="that-70s-shows-why-the-disco-decade-is-back-in-fashion">That 70s shows: why the disco decade is back in fashion</h3>
<p>There is a logical, mathematical explanation for why the 70s have been pronounced chic by Paris fashion week. The 90s are the new 70s, you see, and the 70s are the new 50s. It goes like this. When the 70s were the recent past, they were cringe-makingly close to home, and therefore easy to poke fun at.</p>
<p>Now, the 90s are the relatively past--and so 90s revivalism has become fashion's go-to gag. The 70s, meanwhile, have slipped into rose-tinted memory, the embarrassing parts forgotten along the way. The decade is coming to stand for classic chic, in the way what the 50s previously did before being consigned to ancient history.</p>
<p>The 70s became headline news in Paris this week because of Hedi Slimane at Celine. Instead of going back to Old Celine, he went to Old Old Celine--an untra-bourgeois late--70s version of what ladylike looks like, with attitude and great wedge boots. And the fashion industry looked at the collection and thought: 'That's exactly what I want to wear.'</p>
<p>It is hard to avoid plundering the 70s when its influence is everywhere on the catwalk, which means the trickle-down effect from show to pavement was already well under way on the streets of Paris.</p>
<p>So how did they wear it? Layered, mostly, and in a 70s palette of browns, greens and yellows. The art director Sofia Sanchez de Betak probably won the look. The thrown-together layering of tie, tweed blazer, trench and scarf in various shades of brown and grey was a direct reference to Annie Hall--bourgeois Manhattanite is something to aim for.</p>
<h3 id="when-we-dream-we-have-the-perfect-chemical-canvas-for-intense-visions">'When we dream, we have the perfect chemical canvas for intense visions'</h3>
<p>When we dream, the logic centres of our brain -- the frontal lobes -- go dark, and chemicals associated with self-control, like serotonin and norepinephrine, drop.</p>
<h3 id="why-indias-election-is-among-the-worlds-most-expensive">Why India's election is among the world's most expensive?</h3>
<p>India will soon hold what's likely to be one of the world's costliest elections. The polling exercise will cost an unprecedented 500 billion rupees ($7 billion), according to the New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies.</p>
<p>It is a bunch of panicky candidates throwing money around to voters but also to vendors selling all kinds of stuff useful in a political campaign.</p>
<h4 id="rallying-the-troops-with-chicken-curry">Rallying the troops with chicken curry</h4>
<p>Indian politicians love a good rally: They crisscross the country, corralling locals into large tents where they're bombarded with campaign rhetoric. To attract a crow, some politicians may need to offer a box of food filled with chicken curry that can be too expensive for average citizens.</p>
<h4 id="dummy-candidates">Dummy candidates</h4>
<p>India's Election Commission has long warned about dummy candidates: nominating someone with the same name to confuse voters and split the vote. But even fielding dummy candidates can cost as much as 120 million rupees.</p>
<h4 id="brand-building-make-india-great-again-swag">Brand building: Make India Great Again Swag</h4>
<p>As much as 26 million rupees will be spent on advertising in the upcoming elections. In February alone, more than 40 million rupees was spent on political advertising on just one site--Facebook. Them there are T-shirts with the slogan "Namo Again" (Narendra Modi Again) peddled by his camp.</p>
<h3 id="a-hit-tv-series-in-china-skewers-cranky-old-parents">A hit TV series in China skewers cranky old parents</h3>
<p>It is no mean feat to be one of top-ten trending hashtags on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, for 20 consecutive days and counting. "All is Well", a show on provincial television which premiered on March 1st, has done just that.</p>
<p>The show tells the story of a fictional Chinese family torn by internal conflict. The female protagonist, Su Mingyu, is barely on speaking terms with her widowed father and one of her two brothers. The father is a nagging crank who expects his two adult sons to bankroll his lavish tastes. This leads to constant bickering between the brothers, neither of whom want to be called unfilial.</p>
<p>Many Chinese can relate to the Su family's troubles. The daughter holds a grudge against her father, and especially against her late mother, for having mistreated her while pampering her brothers.</p>
<p>But the biggest reaction has been to the drama's critique of filial piety. Even today, the Confucian principle of unswerving loyalty to one's parents remains hallowed. Many people say the best measure of adherence to this virtue is whether a son takes good care of his parents in old age.</p>
<p>In the series, however, the widowed father does not attract much sympathy. He throws tantrums and insists that his eldest son buy him a three-bedroom apartment (the som grudgingly does so). Commentators on social media have taken to calling the father a juying ("giant baby")--a characteristic common among parents in real life, they say. The Su children do their duty, but the audience is supposed to applaud the resentment they express.</p>
<h3 id="the-worlds-most-expensive-cities">The world's most expensive cities</h3>
<p>For the first time in its 30-year history, the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit gives the title of the world's most expensive city to three places. Singapore marks its sixth straight year at the top of the rankings, and is joined there by Hong Kong and Paris. The survey, which compares prices across 160 products and services, finds that living costs in all there cities are 7% higher than in New York, the benchmark city. Two Swiss cities, Zurich and Geneva, and Osaka in Japan also have higher prices than New York; Copenhagen and Seoul cost tha same as the Big Apple.</p>
<p>Strong economic growth in the United States in 2018 led to a sharp appreciation of the dollar and a rise up the rankings for 14 of the 16 American cities for which prices are collected. The highest climbers were San Francisco (up 12 places to 25th) and Houston (up to 30th from 41st); New York itself moved up six spots to seventh and Los Angeles rose by four places to tenth. These movements represent a sharp increase in the relative cost of living compared with five years ago, when New York and Los Angeles tied in 39th position.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, inflation, devaluations and economic turmoil caused the cost of living in Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Venezuela to plunge. Turkey's currency crisis and surging consumer-price inflation saw Istanbul drop 48 places to joint 120th. But Caracas in Venezuela claims the title of the least expensive city in the world, thanks to hyperinflation and the plummeting bolivar.</p>
<h3 id="the-unstoppable-love-of-the-snowplow-parent">The unstoppable love of the snowplow parent</h3>
<p>Taken to its criminal extreme, that means bribing SAT proctors and paying off college coaches to get children into elite colleges--and then going to great lengths to make sure they never face the humiliation of knowing how they got there.</p>
<p>Learning to solve problems, take risks and overcome frustration are crucial life skills, many child development experts say, and if parents don't let their children encounter failure, the children don't acquire them.</p>
<h3 id="americans-are-going-bankrupt-from-getting-sick">Americans are going bankrupt from getting sick</h3>
<p>Still, some patients do wind up with medical debt, which discourages them from seeking medical care, because they fear they will incur even more debt if they go to the doctor again. In the end, they get sicker, and risk plunging even further into debt.</p>
<p>When everything fails, and the person is at imminent risk of having wages garnished because they've been sued for medical debt, it might be time to file for bankruptcy, says Sandoval-Moshenberg. The people who do become the tip of a very big debt iceberg.</p>
<h3 id="starbucks-china-challenger-luckin-to-raise-up-to-800-million-in-u.s.-ipo-sources">Starbucks' China challenger Luckin to raise up to $800 million in U.S. IPO: sources</h3>
<p>Luckin Coffee Inc, the Chinese challenger to Starbucks Corp, filed on Monday for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) through which, sources said, it is looking to raise up to $800 million.</p>
<p>Luckin has waged its cash-burning caffeine war with generous subsidies, speedy delivery and viral promotions on social media, which in turn has also pushed Starbucks to form a tie-up with local tech giant Alibaba to deliver coffee to customers.</p>
<p>The big question for the brand long terms is if, when it rolls back discounts, enough customers stick around.</p>
<h3 id="k-pop-stardom-lures-japanese-youth-to-korea-despite-diplomatic-chill">K-Pop stardom lures Japanese youth to Korea despite diplomatic chill</h3>
<p>She is one of an estimated one million other K-pop star wannabes, from South Korea and abroad, hoping to get a shot at super competitive auditions by majot talent agencies that will take on just a select few as "trainees".</p>
<p>The influx of Japanese talent that is reshaping the K-pop industry comes at a time of increasingly bitter political acrimony between the two countries that has damaged diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>That the tension has done little to dent the K-pop craze among Japanese youth, and the willingness by Korean agencies to take on Japanese talent, speak to the strength of the ties between their people.</p>
<p>Some Japanese transplants have already made it big. The three Japanese members of the girl band Twice helped make the group the second most popular act in Japan, after BTS.</p>
<p>Agencies officials are reluctant to discuss their success in Japan and the infusion of Japanese talent, wary of fuelling a politically charged backlash, industry sources said.</p>
<h3 id="what-male-ceos-are-wearing">What male CEOs are wearing</h3>
<p>It now seems like years ago that Silicon Valley's hoodie culture made male executives' wardrobes more casual across most industries. From financial companies to insurers to automakers, traditional dress codes morphed into "dress appropriately."</p>
<p>Now executive men in more traditional offices are arguing out how to dress down but still look professional, and those at tech firms are growing up and wondering how to dress up but still look cool.</p>
<p>"It should look effortless. People shouldn't be able to put their finger on why you look as good as you do," said Nick Hart, founder of Spencer Hart.</p>
<p>Here are some items high-powered men are wearing when dressing for work and weekends:</p>
<p>The sneakers: Sneakers have gone totally upscale, with eye-popping price tags to match. Some executives will throw down more than $1,000 for a pair.</p>
<p>The jeans Of course, great jeans with a blazer and smart loafers, if not sneakers, is a modern classic look.</p>
<p>Some handsome staples include the JBrand Kane fit jeans, the AG Graduate fit, and the Frame L'Homme, said Jacci Jaye of Wall Street Stylist.</p>
<p>The glasses If you have to wear glasses, there's no reason they can't add a touch of style. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is often seen in a striking pair.</p>
<p>For colorful frames that are not exorbitantly priced, you might try Eyebobs. The company has noted that top execs like Revlon chairman Ron Perelman have been spotted in them.</p>
<h3 id="trum-administration-owes-americans-answers-about-restrictions-on-huawei">Trum administration owes Americans answers about restrictions on Huawei</h3>
<p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's global influence has been steadily growing in recent years, and the U.S. government's concern has been growing along with it.</p>
<p>Fearing that the spread of Chinese-made cellphones, routers and other equipment may render Western countries, including those that share the most sensitive intelligence with the United States, vulnerable to Beijing, Washington has tried to hold Huawei accountable for alleged intellectual-property theft -- while discouraging key allies such as Britain, Australia and New Zealand from relying on Huawei technology.</p>
<h3 id="rihanna-breaking-new-ground-joins-with-lvmh-for-fashion-brand">Rihanna, breaking new ground, joins with LVMH for fashion brand</h3>
<p>On Friday, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group, officially confirmed not only that the fashion line created by Rihanna was becoming part of its glided stable but also that the first products from the new company would be unveiled -- in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The Group resources are notably large -- LVMH reported first-quarter revenue in April of 12.5 billion euros ($14.1 billion), an increase of 16% -- and the emphasis on "multicultural," in a time when many luxury brands are suffering from charges of cultural insensitivity and discrimination, is significant.</p>
<p>Fenty, however, has made inclusivity of all kinds -- size, race, gendet identity -- part of its identity from the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="how-creepy-is-your-smart-speaker">How creepy is your smart speaker?</h3>
<p>As Alexa herself contends, smart speakers are not sending every utterance into the the tech giants' digital vaults. Despite their name, the devices are simple-minded. They listen out for wake words, and then send what follows to the cloud as an audio clip; when an answer arrives, in the form of another audio clip, they play it back.</p>
<p>But Amazon notes that users can delete these clips at any time. There's always the mute button if you are worried about accidentally triggering your speaker and sending a clip into the cloud during a sensitive conversation. Users, the firm insists, are in control.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced by such assurance, however. Are their makers using them to snoop on people and then exploiting that information to target online ads or offer them particular products?</p>
<p>If eavesdropping is your problem, eschewing smart speakers does not resolve it. Smartphones, which people blithely carry around with them, are even worse. Spy agencies are said to be able to activate the microphone in such devices.</p>
<h3 id="a-majority-of-americans-want-abortion-to-be-legal-in-the-first-two-trimesters">A majority of Americans want abortion to be legal in the first two trimesters</h3>
<p>In the abortion argument, both sides long ago drove each other to extremes. The pro-life, fundamentalist view behind the Alabama bill is that a fertilised egg is no different from a person, and thus should enjoy the same legal rights. Accept that, and what right does a woman have to take a morning-after pill, or to end a pregnancy after a rape? The pro-choice extreme is that any restriction on abortion is an unacceptable attempt by government to control women's bodies. With debate</p>
<h3 id="the-joy-of-absence">The joy of absence</h3>
<p>Turning an office into a prison, with inmates allowed home for the evenings, does nothing for the creativity that is increasingly demanded of office workers as routine tasks are automated. To be productive you need absence of mind, not being present in the flesh.</p>
<h3 id="nearing-the-endgame-is-hollywoods-lust-for-sequels-destroying-cinema">Nearing the endgame: is Hollywood's lust for sequels destroying cinema?</h3>
<p>The industry's eagerness to recycle is not hard to explain. Revenue is a big factor. Of the all-time top 10 grossing films, six are now sequels. More important than the scale of these earnings is their reliability. Nobody knows whether an untried property will succeed, but the success of a sequel is virtually guaranteed.</p>
<p>Just why sequels are so successful is no mystery either. They meet intense audience demand. Nothing whets filmgoers' appetites like what the industry calls "preawareness". Informed anticipation is part of the fun, and provide a ready topic od conversation.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the sequels juggernaut is throttling fresh ideas, the lifeblood of any creativity. It may be offering the movies a short-term fix by imperilling their long-term health.</p>
<p>Our world is in flux, and yet we are not encouraged to engage with change. Instead, we are offered the chance to retreat into thought bunkers with those of like mind, and cut ourselves off from unsettling ideas.</p>
<p>It is understandable that in such circumstances we should look to the big screen for the comfort of repetition. Children find it consoling to be told the same bedtime story every night. Maybe, however, it is time for filmgoers to grow up.</p>
<h3 id="why-grown-ups-keep-talking-like-little-kids">Why Grown-Ups Keep Talking Like Little Kids?</h3>
<p>More and more. adults are sprinkling their speech with the language of children. The adoption of some of these linguistic tics by adults has given rise to a register we might call kidspeak.</p>
<p>Clearly, kidspeak affords its users certain rhetorical advantages -- the way it playfully softens blows is part of why younger people on social media now often couch what they say to one another in toddler-esque. But what made bright teenagers and 20-somethings start imitating 5-year-olds in the first place? And why are many older Americans following suit?</p>
<p>Young people today are afraid in ways that generations before them were not. They're facing new, compounding economic hardships -- many Millennials and older members of Gen Z depend on their parents to help cover exorbitant rents or student-loan payments. A pair of 2016 studies led by April Smith, a psychology professor in Miami University, in Ohio, showed that over the past few decades, young people have become newly fearful of reaching adulthood, agreeing more and more with statements such as "I wishh that I could return to the security of childhood" and disagreeing with ones such as "I feel happy that I am not a child anymore."</p>
<p>A generation understandably spooked by "adulting" may well embrace the linguistic comfort food of childlike language. And once established. the habit can easily make the jump to those of us more advanced in years. After all, a kid lurks inside every one of us, and few people are immune to the sheer infectiousness of creativity.</p>

<p>Here's a hypothetical: a telescope detects an asteroid between 100 and 300 meters in diameter racing through our solar system at 14 kilometers per second, 57 million kilometers from Earth.</p>
<p>This week's exercise seeks to stimulate global response to a catastrophic meteorite. The first step is aiming telescopes at the threat to precisely calculate its speed and trajectory, following rough initial estimate.</p>
<p>Then it boils down to two choices: try to deflect the object, or evacuate. If it is less than 165 feet in diameter, the international consensus is to evacuate the threatened region. What about bigger objects? The plan is to launch a device toward the divert its trajectory -- like a cosmic bumper car.</p>
<h3 id="british-politics-after-theresa-may">British politics after Theresa May</h3>
<p>Theresa May strode out of the door of 10 Downing Street in a crimson business suit and bowed to the inevitable. Having failed three times to get her Brexit deal through a hopelessly divided parliament, and confronted with a Tory insurrection over her proposed fourth attempt, she announced on May 24th tha she would step down as leader of the Conservative Party and Britain's prime minister.</p>
<p>The immediate trigger for Mrs May's departure was the failure of her revised withdrawal bill. But the bigger trigger was the general election that she called back in June 2017. Her instincts were right: increasing the Tories' majority would have allowed her to increase her bargaining power with her party and ensure that she was not hostage to pro- or anti- Brexit factions. But the election was a debacle.</p>
<p>British politics will now be consumed by the race to succeed Mrs May. The next leader will have to grapple with the same forces that have destroyed Mrs May: a country as well as a party that is torn over Brexit; a political system that is being pulled apart by the tension between representative and direct democracy; and a conflict with the European Union that, despite repeated statements to the contrary by Brexiteers, has most of the cards in its hand. Mrs May will not be the last prime minister to be brought to tears by Brexit.</p>
<h3 id="techs-latest-stars-have-it-all----except-a-path-to-high-profits">Tech's latest stars have it all -- except a path to high profits</h3>
<p>Investors often describe world of business in terms of animals. Right now, mere ponies are being represented as unicorns: privately held tech firms worth over $1bn that are supposedly strong and world-beating -- miraculous almost.</p>
<p>As we report this week, a dozen unicorns that have listed, or are likely to, posted combined losses of $14bn last year. Their cumulative losses are $47bn. Their services, from ride-hailing to office rental, are often deeply discounted in order to supercharge revenue growth. The justification for this is the Silicon Valley doctrine of "blitzscaling" in order to conquer "winner-takes-all" markets -- or in plain English, conducting a high-speed land grab in the hope of finding gold.</p>
<p>The big worry is that the unicorns' losses reflect not temporary growing pains but markets which are contested and customers who are promiscuous. Despite subsides, ride-sharing customers are not locked in to one firm. No wonder Lyft's shares have fallen by over 20% below their IPO price. Anyone can lease an office and rent out desks, not just WeWork.</p>
<p>External forces will make blitzscaling harder, too. Compared with the earlier generations of firms, today a reaction is in full swing, including over digital taxes and data and content laws.</p>
<p>All this is good for consumers. Investors, meanwhile, need to hold their nerve. It is tempting to extrapolate the triumph of Google and Alibaba to an entire new group of firms.</p>
<p>The blitzscale philosophy of buying customers at any price is speaking. After the unicorns, a new and more convincing species of startup will have to be engineered.</p>
<h3 id="theyre-brilliant-liverpool-fans-line-streets-to-honour-idols">'They're brilliant': Liverpool fans line streets to honour idols</h3>
<p>Under leaden English skies, Liverpool became a carnival of red on Sunday as the football-mad city hailed its heroes for bringing home the Champions League trophy for the first time in 14 years.</p>
<p>It followed an epic season in which Liverpool narrowly missed out on a first league title in three decades, causing agony -- now somewhat relieved -- for fans impatient to end the long wait.</p>
<p>Celebrations ran late into the night in Liverpool city centre, as ecstatic supporters danced drunkenly in the streets singing a repertoire of the club's anthems.</p>
<p>The morning after, bleary-eyed fans began streaming back onto the streets ahead of the parade, which worked its way slowly towards the city centre.</p>
<p>A jubilant atmosphere rippled through the city, as all manner of Liverpool flags flew from buildings and cars, drivers sounded horns and fans carried everything from banners to balloon replicas of the trophy.</p>
<h3 id="want-a-visa-for-the-u.s.-youll-have-to-hand-over-your-social-media-handles">Want a visa for the U.S.? You'll have to hand over your social media handles</h3>
<p>For now the form only includes the most popular social media platforms, but soon applicants will be able to list all the sites they use. "As we've seen around the world in recent years, social media can be a major forum for terrorist sentiment and activity. This will be a vital tool to screen out terrorists, public safety threats, and other dangerous individuals from gaining immigration benefits and setting foot on U.S. soil," the official added.</p>
<p>When the new rule was proposed last year, the ACLU called it "ineffective and deeply problematic". The move "will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official," the ACLU said.</p>
<h3 id="western-firms-increasingly-admire----and-want----chinese-technology">Western firms increasingly admire -- and want -- Chinese technology</h3>
<p>American officials have been treating technology bosses to classified briefings on the dangers of doing business in China. Those who operate there see things differently.</p>
<p>For the first time last year, in annual poll by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, a majority of foreign companies (61%) said that domestic firms were as innovative as European ones, or more so. This year four-fifths of them saw opportunities in Chinese sparkiness.</p>
<p>Today, acquiring a Chinese startup can help some foreign firms gain an edge. Takeover targets have their own research teams, patents, clients and, sometimes, lavish state subsidies.</p>
<p>All told, American technology companies have invested $1bn in Chinese ones since the start of last year, according to Dealogic, a data provider. Without trade tensions and the technological cold war, deals would multiply. That they now might not will delight America's spooks. Its companies, less so.</p>
<h3 id="female-spies-and-their-secrets">Female spies and their secrets</h3>
<p>Are women useful as spies? If so, in what capacity? Maxwell Knight, an officier in MI5, Britain's domestic-counterintelligence agency, sat pondering these questions. Outside his office, World War II had begun, and Europe's baptism by blitzkrieg was under way. In England the intelligence community was still an all-male domain. But a lady spy could come in handy, as Knight was about to opine.</p>
<p>Intelligence officers had long presumed that women's special assets for spying were limited to strategically deployed female abilities: batting eyelashes, soliciting pillow talk, and of course maintaining files and typing reports. Overseeing operations? Not so much.</p>
<p>World War II, a "total war" that required all able male bodies for global fighting, offered new opportunities.</p>
<p>As Sarah Rose writes in D-Day Girls, women were considered good couriers -- a high-risk role -- because they could rely on ingratiation and seeming naivete as tools in tight spots. The war also provided openings for women to show that they could execute operations, masking strategic life-and-death decisions.</p>
<p>Virginia Hall was, as the British journalist Sonia Purnell writes, "the most successful Allied female secret agent." SHe directed guerrilla forces to support the D-Day landings. Disguised as a milkmaid, she sold cheese and eavesdropped on the German Seventh Army, which, Purnell writes, helped "pave the wat for the Allied recapture of Paris."</p>
<p>However, after the war, the contribution of these women was overlooked and then forgotten. In 1953, the head of the CIA, Allen Dulles, convened a "Petticoat Panel" to look into attitudes toward women at the agency. Compared with men, they were seen as more emotional, less objective, and insufficiently aggressive.</p>
<p>That was then. Now the CIA is directed by a woman, Gina Haspel, who has promoted veteran women to head top directorates. These leaders have antecedents, whether or not they know it.</p>
<h3 id="why-monica-from-friends-is-this-summers-unlikely-style-icon">Why Monica from Friends is this summer's unlikely style icon?</h3>
<p>If you tuned into Channel 4 every Friday night when Friends ran the first time around, from 1994, your favorite Friends character was Joey (the adorable one), Rachel (the sexy one), Chandler (the funny one) or Phoebe (the eccentric one). But in the second coming of Friends, since all 236 episodes arrived on Netflix in January of last year, Monica has unexpectedly found a breakout role as a style icon.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that the first time around, nobody was watching Friends for wardrobe tips. Audiences tuned into Friends not for the wardrobe or the lifestyle, but because it was really funny. It's just as funny this time around. But what adds an frisson to watching in 2019 is the fact that the 20-year revival cycle that drives fashion has the effect of making the outfits look delightfully retro and, somehow, absolutely right for now.</p>
<p>What does it say about 2019 that Monica has leapfrogged Rachel to become the breakout style icon of the Friends revival? Rachel, the girl next door, always supercute in a waitress apron, tucking those blowdried strands behind one ear, is perhaps little too stay-in-your-lane girly for current tastes. Monica had a seam of tomboy running through her character and her wardrobe. But when she dresses up, she could pull off a spaghetti strap dress or a black lace cami with the aplomb of 90s supermodel.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-word-for-condescending-geezer-reveals-a-lot-about-hierarchy-in-south-korea">A new word for "condescending geezer" reveals a lot about hierarchy in South Korea</h3>
<p>Kkondae is a modern word of uncertain origin -- perhaps an adaption of the English word "condescend". It means an older pearson, usually a man, who expects unquestioning obedience from people who are junior. South Koreans apply the word to everyone from narcissistic bosses to overbearing uncles and corrupt politicians.</p>
<p>South Korea is notorious for its suffocating workplace hierarchies based on age, sex and length of service. Many South Koreans are outraged when younger colleagues or relatives fail to use the correct honorific to address them.</p>
<p>However, the popularity of kkondae as an insult is a sign of change. Open rebellion against hierarchical strictures is still rare and frowned upon. But young people are beginning to question authority.</p>
<p>South Korea's evolving political culture has been making an impact, too. Since democracy began to take hold in the country in the late 1980s, belief in universal rights, including people's right to be treated equally, has become stronger. This encouraged people to question their deference to others.</p>
<p>An ancient culture of authority is unlikely to disappear overnight. Young people are becoming more willing to challenge hierarchy, but what will happen as they get older? Some of today's young upstarts will not achieve the success they dream of. They may find themselves yearning for the kind of deference their elders once automatically enjoyed. Today's kknondae critics may grow up to be kknondae themselves. But whether tomorrow's young people will let them get away with that is doubtful.</p>
<h3 id="a-horrible-way-to-die-how-chernobyl-recreated-a-nuclear-meltdown">'A horrible way to die': how Chernobyl recreated a nuclear meltdown</h3>
<p>The job of Daniel Parker, head of makeup and prosthetic, had no such light touches either. His task was to recreate the effect of radiation burns on human skin. Ask Parker what radiation does to the body and he is distressingly blunt. "You melt," he says. "The only way you can really describe it is putting salt on a slug. Tissue is breaking down. Skin just slips off. It'll just go. One day you move your arm and the skin will just fall off."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Parker didn't look to photos of Hiroshima or Nagasaki victims for examples of radiation damage. He went instead to medical textbooks, and this allowed him to pioneer a technique for Chernobyl where the "layered" the skin: painting the actors' bodies with wounds, then putting a semi-translucent layer on top, giving the impression that sores are forcing themselves to the surface as the body degrades from within. The effect is dreadful to see. Yet, Parker was strict in saying these men must not be relegated to Hollywood "zombies", and he explains that the director make sure sympathy stayed within these characters: even as they lie rigid on the bed, gurgling and fading, they still speak, and a wife may still hold her husband's rotting fingers.</p>
<p>"It's the worst way to die," says Parker. "Beyond anything you can imagine. The most horrible way to die. I think it's the worst, in line with medieval torture." What makes it particularly atrocious is that the victims were denied pain relief. In the latter stages oof radiation sickness you cannot inject morphine, he explains. "The walls of the veins are breaking down."</p>
<h3 id="too-many-people-want-to-travel">Too Many People Want to Travel</h3>
<p>This phenomenon is knows as overtourism. A confluence of macroeconomic factors and changing business trends have led more tourists. That has led to environmental degradation, dangerous conditions, and the immiseration and pricing-out of locals in many places. And it has cities around the world asking one questions: Is there anything to be done about being too popular?</p>
<p>There's too much of a good thing in some of these spots, and mayors in some of these spots, and mayors and city councils are doing their part to take it away. A mumber of places have implemented or expanded or proposed tourist taxes. Governments are also rolling out regulations. Those kinds of measures stand to become more important in the coming years, as the global middle class gets bigger, social media more ubiquitous, and travel cheaper.</p>
<p>These phenomena inevitably mean more complaints from locals, and more damage and lines and selfies and bad behavior. But they also mean more cross-cultural exposure, more investment, more global connection, more democratization of travel, and perhaps more awe and wonder. Even overtourism has its upsides.</p>
<h3 id="alabama-lawmakers-approve-chemical-castration-for-sex-offenders">Alabama lawmakers approve 'chemical castration' for sex offenders</h3>
<p>A bill in Alabama awaiting the governor's signature would require people convicted of certain sex offenses to undergo "chemical castration".</p>
<p>Reducing someone's sex drive does not necessarily prevent reoffending, he said, because libido is not the only motivating factor behind sexual abuse.</p>
<p>"I think sexual assault has always been more than just about sex," Marshall said. "It's about power, it's about exercising control over someone else and a variety of other things."</p>
<h3 id="this-means-everything-to-the-city-toronto-parties-as-raptors-clinch-nba-title">'This means everything to the city': Toronto parties as Raptors clinch NBA title</h3>
<p>After nearly 25 years of ambition marred by disappointment and frustration, the Toronto Raptors have brought the city -- and country --its first-ever NBA championship. As Game of 6 of the NBA finals ended and the team hoisted the coveted Larry O'Brien trophy, tens of thousands of Toronto residents poured into the streets, converting busy thoroughfares and city squares into temples of celebration.</p>
<p>Fans in the city's downtown core scaled anything they could -- including buses, buildings and traffic lights -- as car horns blared and the night was lit up by fireworks. Police blocked off major roads to allow fans to celebrate util the early hours of Friday.</p>
<p>Much of what fuelled the energy was a belied that Toronto had been unjustly overlooked by analysts and the broader basketball community. Even though the Raptors methodically dispatched elite teams one-by-one, the cognoscenti of the NBA had Golden State, the reigning champions, as the favorites.</p>
<h3 id="defense-in-china-students-beheading-in-illinois-says-he-did-it">Defense in China student's beheading in Illinois says he did it</h3>
<p>Brendt Christensen, 29, could face the death penalty if he is convicted in the June 2017 abduction and murder of Yingying Zhang, a 26-year-old student at the university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
<p>Christensen's defence lawyer acknowledged in his opening statement that his client killed Zhang but disputed the prosecution's version of events. "You need to know who Brendt was and what he was gion through -- a downward spiral in his life," George Taseff told the jury as he sought to protect his client from the death penalty.</p>
<p>Christensen took Zhang to his apartment where she fought for her life as he hit her over the head with a baseball bat, raped her and stabbed her in the neck before cutting off her head, Miller said.</p>
<p>"Her blood ran down the wall," Miller said, as Zhang's relatives listened to an interpreter through headsets. "Thousands of miles away from her parents, alone with a stranger, she breaths her last breath."</p>
<h3 id="japans-anime-industry-in-crisis-even-as-its-popularity-soars">Japan's anime industry in crisis even as its popularity soars</h3>
<p>Three of the 10 feature films in the running for top prize at the world's most important animation festival in Annecy in France are from Japan.</p>
<p>With talk of a talent shortage, its greatest star, the legendary Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki, has come out of retirement at 78 to make "How Do You Live?" -- with speculation that he could take on another feature if his health holds.</p>
<p>Yoshiaki Nishimura, a former Miyazaki stalwart who produced the Oscar-nominated "The Tale of The Princess Kaguya", told AFR that his peers also complain of low pay, a paucity of emerging young talent and burn-out in overworked animation teams who often put in 12- to 18-hour days.</p>
<p>Amel Lacombe, whose company Eurozoom is a key French animation distributor, said the industry's travails are due to its rapid growth, and now "we are in a period of adjustment". She believes that the Japanese authorities are waking up to anime's importance and global reach "as a export force".</p>
<h3 id="an-ageless-question-when-is-someone-old">An ageless question: When is someone 'old'?</h3>
<p>Scherbov explained that young and old are relative notions, and their common reference point is life expectancy. It makes sense that "old" would vary between nations, especially between more-and less-developed countries, with differences in education, mortality rates, access to health care and life expectancy.</p>
<p>But who is "old" also varies -- widely -- between individuals. The point, says Scherbov, is that personal age is dependent on our "characteristic" -- cognitive abilities, disability, health history and even education levels. Those with more education tend not to smoke, exercise more frequently, have better diets and have regular checkups -- and, therefore, live longer, meaning their old-age threshold comes later, says Scherbov.</p>
<h3 id="why-spoilers-are-ruining-storytelling">Why spoilers are ruining storytelling</h3>
<p>Today, writers and film-makers are obsessed with spoilers. Anthony and Joseph Russo, the directors of Marvel films, have issued statements requesting that fans not ruin them for others. Audiences are zealous about the matter, too. One fan was assaulted outside a screening of "Avengers: Endgame" for "loudly revealing" the movie's outcome.</p>
<p>Film-makers realised that fans were invested in the surprise and pandered to them. The Russo brothers begging viewers not to ruin the Avengers films probably helped them to secure the biggest opening weekend in film history. See it now, that seemed to say. or have someone else spoil it for you.</p>
<p>However, this attitude stifles proper discussion of stories by critics as much as viewers, and it inflicts damage on storytelling as a craft. By promoting one technique, the twist. and one effect, surprise, stories get bent out of shape. They try too hard to counter expectation and resist predictability.</p>
<p>Stories that promote surprise over character end up as mere soap opera, a series of sensational shocks. That corrodes credibility, while some reveals do not so much blow minds as waste time. More significant than all of this, though, is the fact that surprise is overrated.</p>
<h3 id="why-woody-isnt-wooden">Why Woody isn't wooden?</h3>
<p>This summer. one of the most versatile performances working today returns to the screen. Over the past 34 years, he has proved himself a consummate comedian, a fearless action hero and a compelling leading man.</p>
<p>He's Sheriff Woody, the floppy, knock-kneed, pull-string doll with the voice of Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>Since "Toy Story" began, Woody, the diminutive protagonist, has delivered what are, by any measure, delightful and engaging performances. Behind them are the combined efforts of scores of animators -- around 100 on "Toy Story 4" alone.</p>
<p>A live-action performance occurs, often intuitively, in the moment, while animation can look more like the work of technicians than thespians. Laboring in dimly lit rooms on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, animators spend a lot of time staring at computer monitors. With Woody as something like their high-tech onscreen marionette, they painstakingly contrive one pose, one movement and one facial expression at a time -- frame by frame, scene by scene -- until he begins to resemble a living, breathing character.</p>
<h3 id="homophobic-and-transphobic-hate-crimes-surge-in-england-and-wales">Homophobic and transphobic hate crimes surge in England and Wales</h3>
<p>Homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, including stalking, harassment and violent assault, have more than doubled in England and Wales over five years, a Guardian analysis has shown.</p>
<p>The findings come after two women were attacked on a bus in London for refusing to kiss in front of a group of men. The incident sparked widespread condemnation.</p>
<p>The rate of LBGT hate crime per capita rose by 144% between 2013-14 and 2017-18. In the most recent year of data, police recorded 11,600 crimes, more than doubling from 4,600 during this period.</p>
<p>Campaigners said the rise could partly be down to better reporting but added that hatred was growing on British streets because of the rise of rightwing populism.</p>
<p>Taz Edwards-White, an alliance manager at Metro, an equalities and diversity organisation, said the hate crime figures were likely to be 'the tip of the iceberg'.</p>
<p>'What we see in our services is lots of people experience day-to-day verbal attacks or violence and aggressive language and homophobic attitudes … We do believe the political climate has had an impact: people feel unsafe. What is happening in central government and all the scapegoating has an effect. We saw a spike [in racist attacks] after Brexit and there has been a steady increase since then.'</p>
<h3 id="a-starving-polar-bear-wandered-into-a-russian-city-scavenging-for-food">A starving polar bear wandered into a Russian city, scavenging for food</h3>
<p>Photos showed the female animal trudging across a busy road with muddy paws, digging through rubble and trash and lying down from apparent exhaustion on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts believe the animal, initially thought to have wandered hundreds of miles from its natural habitat in the Arctic, instead may have been taken as a cub and raised in captivity by pelt traders, according to the Siberian Times.</p>
<p>The experts explained that it is typically males, not females, that migrate long distances, and said this polar bear was too clean to have made such a trek, the newspaper reported. They told the newspaper it's possible that poachers released the animal to avoid being caught and punished.</p>
<p>Polar bear poaching has been banned in Russia for more than 60 years. Still, it has been estimated that as many as 200 of them are killed each year in the Far East region.</p>
<p>As the Washington Post's Isaac Stanley-Becker reported, polar bears "are classified as a vulnerable species because of the 'ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change,' according to the World Wildlife Fund."</p>
<h3 id="the-queen-of-eating-shellfish-online">The queen of eating shellfish online</h3>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people tune in each week to watch Bethany Gaskin binge-eat shellfish on YouTube.</p>
<p>Gaskin, 44, has capitalized on the popularity if a food-video genre known as mukbang, which involves scarfing down, on camera, more grub than should rightly be consumed in a single sitting.</p>
<p>On her two YouTube channels, Gaskin chats up her audience while eating king crab legs, mussels, lobster tails, hard-boiled eggs and roasted red potatoes.</p>
<p>Mukbang seems to have begun as an internet trend more than a decade ago in South Korea. The name is a mash-up of the Korean words for let's eat ('muk-ja) and broadcasting ('bang-song'). Korean live-streamers often schedule their mukbang videos to align with dinnertime hours, so their viewers eating alone at home feel like they're sharing a meal with a friend.</p>
<p>Viewers cite other benefits too. Watching the videos can serve as an appetite-curbing exercise.</p>
<p>Though the chatter around mukbang videos trends to focus on their benefits, there are also some who see reason for concern. Theresa Kinsella, 42, a dietitian, said in a phone interview that these videos 'glorify overeating,' promote disordered eating and ignore the possible risks associated with overconsumption.</p>
<p>'The short-term health risk are physical discomfort, gastrointestinal distress, lethargy and fatigue,' Kinsella said. As for the long-term effects, she cited weight gain, heart diseases and diabetes.</p>

<p>The encounter at the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone -- their third in person -- came a day after Trump raised the prospect of a border handshake in a tweet and declared he'd have "no problem" stepping into North Korea.</p>
<h3 id="chinas-grand-sci-fi-is-going-global">China's grand sci-fi is going global</h3>
<p>As China's economy has grown over the past 30 years, its sci-fi writers' vision has expanded, too. Their stories tend to focus on Earth itself -- eschewing galaxies far far away and long ago -- while being conceived on a stupendous scale. One recurring wide-angle shot in " The Wandering Earth", for example, shows the planet gliding through space on a pincushion of blue flame, its atmosphere trailing off into a vacuum.</p>
<p>The writers of Chinese science fiction anticipated their genre's rising profile. In 2010 Fei Dao, another author, described its devotees as a "lonely hidden army". Chinese sci-fi, he said, might "unexpectedly rush out and change heaven and Earth". That has not quite happened yet. But in the future, anything is possible.</p>
<h3 id="shanghai-citizens-out-of-sorts-over-new-trash-separation-rules">Shanghai citizens out of sorts over new trash separation rules</h3>
<p>Household trash has occupied minds of Shanghai residents this week: specifically, are the contents of their bins "wet", "dry", "hazardous" or "recycle"?</p>
<p>Shanghai aims to eventually burn or recycle all waste. By next year, dry waste incineration and wet waste treatment rates are expected to reach 27,800 tonnes a day, around 80% of the city's total garbage.</p>
<p>China is building hundreds of "waste to energy" plants that use garbage to generate power. Its also establishing a "waste-free city" scheme and constructing high-tech "comprehensive utilization bases" across the country.</p>
<p>"We need to step up the propaganda, and we need to step up the construction of infrastructure and guarantee that the separation of trash meets out requirements," she said.</p>
<h3 id="dogs-eyes-have-changed-since-humans-befriended-them">Dogs' eyes have changed since humans befriended them</h3>
<p>Dogs, more so than almost any other domesticated species, are desperate for human eye contact. It's hard for most people to resist a petulant flash of puppy-dog eyes -- and according to a new study, that pull on the heartstrings might be exactly why dogs can give us those looks at all.</p>
<p>Dogs split off from their wolf relatives -- specifically, gray wolves -- as many as 33,000 years ago. Studying the two animals is a bit like cracking open a four-legged time capsule. A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that dogs' faces are structured for complex expression in a way that wolves' aren't.</p>
<p>For the study, a team looked at two muscles that work together to widen and open dog's eyes, droopier, and objectively cuter. But in the four gray wolves the researchers looked at, neither muscles was present.</p>
<p>Research has also shown that when dogs work these muscles, humans respond more positively. This isn't simply a fortuitous love story, in which the eyes of two species just so happen to meet across a crowded planet. Like all the best partnerships, this one is more likely the result of years of evolution and growth.</p>
<p>For a species to change quickly, a pretty powerful force must be acting on it. And that's where human come in. We connect profoundly with animals capable of exaggerating the size and width of their eyes, which makes them look like our own human babies and "hijacks" our nurturing instincts.</p>
<p>"These muscles evolved during domestication", says Brian Hare, the editor of the paper, "but almost certainly due to an advantage they gave dogs during interactions with humans that we humans have been all but unaware of."</p>
<h3 id="whaling-ships-set-sail-as-japan-resumes-commercial-hunts">Whaling ships set sail as Japan resumes commercial hunts</h3>
<p>Japan began its first commercial whale hunts in more than three decades on Monday, brushing aside outrage over its resumption of a practice that conservationists say is cruel and outdated.</p>
<p>Whaling has long proved a rare diplomatic flashpoint for Tokyo, which says the practice is a Japaneses tradition that should not be subject to international interference.</p>
<p>With its withdraw from the IWC, Tokyo will carry out whale hunting off Japan, but will end the most controversial hunts in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>Some believe that Japan's return to commercial whale hunting will effectively sound the death knell for the industry.</p>
<p>"Japan is quitting high-seas whaling … that is a huge step towards the end of killing whales for their meat and other products," said Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare. He said commercial whaling in Japanese waters was unlikely to have much of a future given dwindling subsides and the shrinking market for whale meat.</p>
<h3 id="with-escape-of-xxs-son-mexico-suffers-a-stunning-defeat">With escape of xx's son, Mexico suffers a stunning defeat</h3>
<p>The latest family member to escape apprehension -- xx's son, yy - managed his own feat of government humiliation this week, when cartel henchmen forced a patrol of armed forces to release him after he had been captured.</p>
<p>The stunning surrender -- with Mexican forces badly outmatched, taken hostage by outlaws and forced to let loose a prominent suspect in their custody -- began with a seige on the city of xxx on Thursday. Videos of fierce gunbattles in the street, armed men blocking roads, residents fleeing to safety and clouds of black smoke rising from burning vehicles swamped social media.</p>
<p>Reports swirled that after the capture of the younger xxx, his cartel mounted a fierce assault to win his freedom and prevent his extradition to the U.S.</p>
<p>The cartel's victory offered a frightening glimpse into the power wielded by organized crime in Mexico, distilling in a single, eight-hour stretch the extent to which the nation is held captive by criminal networks -- without a plan to combat the scourge of violence that has brought the country to its deadliest point in decades.</p>
